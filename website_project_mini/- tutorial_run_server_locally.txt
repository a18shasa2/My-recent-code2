Run server locally: 
- Download and install "XAMPP" here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
- Open "XAMPP Control Panel". 
- Click on "Start" for "Apache" and "Start" for "MySQL". 
- Place website-files in "htdocs" folder.
- In the web browser, write "localhost" to open the index-page.
- The SQL-database is called "phpmyadmin". Access it by writing "localhost/phpmyadmin" in the web browser. The data should be controlled by phpmyadmin and not hard-coded, ideally.  

Note: index-page = first page. 
Note: html-pages can be run directly in web browser. 
      php-pages must be run through https/server in web browser and cannot be run directly.
